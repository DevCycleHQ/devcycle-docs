With EdgeDB you are in complete control of your data. While the primary purpose of EdgeDB is to make data available across platforms, globally. You can also lock down the locales that data is saved to.

When saving data to EdgeDB you can specify which locale the data should be saved to and DevCycle will do the rest, ensuring the user data is only saved to the edge in the right geography and that it is not replicated anywhere that it shouldn't be.

In this way, if you need controls for Data Residency EdgeDB gives you complete control while still simplifying your feature flag setup.
