# DevCycle React Native

The DevCycle React Native SDK lets you easily integrate your React Native web applications with DevCycle.

:::info

DevCycle supports React Native Expo. See the [React Native Expo SDK](/sdk/client-side-sdks/react-native/react-native-expo-install) installation for more information.

:::

:::caution

Extra steps are required to get DevCycle working with React Native Web. See the [React Native Web](#react-native-web) section below for more information.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={4} />

The React Native SDK is available as a package on npm. A separate React Native Expo SDK is available as a package on npm. Both SDKs are also open source and can be viewed on Github.

## Requirements

This SDK is compatible with _React Native_ version 0.64.0 and above.

## React Native Web

To get your React Native Web working with DevCycle, you will need to change one of the rules in the webpack config to include `.cjs` files as one of the file types to be transpiled, e.g.:

```js
const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require('@expo/webpack-config')

module.exports = async function (env, argv) {
  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(env, argv)

  config.module.rules = config.module.rules.map((rule) => {
    if (rule.oneOf instanceof Array) {
      // add "cjs" as an exclusion to this rule to prevent it from being regarded as an asset
      rule.oneOf[rule.oneOf.length - 1].exclude = [
        /\.(js|mjs|jsx|cjs|ts|tsx)$/,
        /\.html$/,
        /\.json$/,
      ]
    }
    return rule
  })

  return config
}
```
