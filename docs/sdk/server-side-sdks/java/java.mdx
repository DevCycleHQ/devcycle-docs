# DevCycle Java Server SDK

Welcome to the DevCycle Java Server SDK. There are two modes for the SDK, Cloud bucketing (using the
[Bucketing API](https://docs.devcycle.com/bucketing-api/)) and Local Bucketing.

We recommend using the Local Bucketing mode by default, as it performs fast local evaluations of your feature flags. If
you need access to [EdgeDB](https://docs.devcycle.com/extras/edgedb) you will need to use the Cloud Bucketing mode of
the SDK.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={4} />

The SDK is available as a package on MavenCentral. It is also open source and can be viewed on Github.
