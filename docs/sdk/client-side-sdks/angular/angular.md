# Angular OpenFeature SDK with DevCycle Provider

DevCycle supports the [OpenFeature Angular SDK](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/client/web/angular). This SDK is a wrapper around the OpenFeature Web SDK that allows you to use DevCycle variables in your Angular application through the OpenFeature APIs.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={6} />

The SDK is available as a package on npm. It is also open source and can be viewed on Github.
