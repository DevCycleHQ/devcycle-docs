# DevCycle Go Server SDK.

Welcome to the DevCycle Go SDK. We have two modes for the SDK. Cloud bucketing (using
the [Bucketing API](https://bucketing-api.devcycle.com))
and Local Bucketing (using the local bucketing engine natively within the SDK).
The SDK is open source and can be viewed on GitHub.
