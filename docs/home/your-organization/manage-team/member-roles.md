## Overview

Roles within DevCycle determine what functionality specific Members in an organization may access. At the moment, all Members may access all functionality except billing.  To read more about Members and how to add them, read [Team Members](/docs/home/your-organization/manage-team/team-members).


### Viewing Roles

Team Member roles are accessed via the [Organization Settings](/docs/home/feature-management/organizing-your-flags-and-variables/organizations-projects#organization-settings) page. 

Once here, navigate to the "Team" page of the settings:

![An Organization's Team Settings Page, with a list of members in the current org](/team.png)

This page will contain a section outlining the roles within DevCycle.

Currently the two roles are: 

**Team Member:** The default permissions assigned to a Member

**Owner:** Full admin permissions across the app

### Editing a Member's Role

There are two ways of editing a Member's role. 

Option one is to directly view the Member's profile. To view the profile of a Team Members within your Organization,  click the "View Profile" button on the Member's list for the Member you wish to view:

This will lead to the Member's profile page where you may modify their role by enabling whichever role the Member should have:

This will show you a list of all Member with that role assigned:
