## Overview

The first thing you need to do to get started with DevCycle is to create an account and organization and add any colleagues to that organization. This page will get you up and running with a Free Account in a couple minutes.

If you already have an account feel free to skip ahead to shipping [Your First Feature](/docs/home/feature-management/getting-started/your-first-feature) with DevCycle.

## Create a New Account

If you don't yet have an account with DevCycle that's not a problem. We have an always free tier and any of our paid tiers come with a full 14 day free trial. To get set up with an account just go to our [plans page](https://devcycle.com/pricing/plans-and-pricing), select the tier you're looking for and sign up to get started.

## Adding Team Members

Creating a Feature Management program is done best with friends. Once you have an account, if you're looking for more info on how to add your colleagues to your organization head on over to our docs for [managing your team on DevCycle](/docs/home/your-organization/manage-team/team-members).
