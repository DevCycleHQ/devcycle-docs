# DevCycle iOS Client SDK

This Client SDK for DevCycle provides a universal Swift Framework to use DevCycle within your iOS / macOS / tvOS /
watchOS application. This SDK uses our Client SDK APIs to perform all user segmentation and bucketing for the SDK,
providing fast response times using our globally distributed edge workers all around the world.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={4} />

The SDK is available as a package on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/DevCycle),
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

It is also open source and can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/ios-client-sdk).
