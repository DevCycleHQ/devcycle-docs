# DevCycle Node.js Server SDK

There are two modes for the SDK, Cloud bucketing (using the [Bucketing API](https://docs.devcycle.com/bucketing-api/)) and Local Bucketing.

We recommend using the Local Bucketing mode by default, as it performs fast local evaluations of your feature flags.
If you need access to [EdgeDB](https://docs.devcycle.com/extras/edgedb) you will need to use the Cloud Bucketing mode of the SDK.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={4} />

The SDK is available as a package on NPM, with a full Typescript interface. 
It is also open source and can be viewed on the [DevCycle GitHub](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/tree/main/sdk/nodejs).
