Welcome to the DevCycle Java SDK, which interfaces with the [DevCycle Bucketing API](/bucketing-api/#tag/devcycle).
All requests, including user data are sent to DevCycle servers to ensure the User is bucketed correctly and will receive the correct variation.

The SDK is available as a package on MavenCentral. It is also open source and can be viewed on Github.
