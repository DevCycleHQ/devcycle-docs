## Installation

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cocoapods" label="CocoaPods" default>

  The SDK can be installed into your iOS project by adding the following to your cocoapod spec:

```swift
pod 'DevCycle'
```
Then, run `pod install`.

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="carthage" label="Carthage">

Include the following in your `Cartfile` to integrate DevCycle as a dependency to your project: 

```swift
github "DevCycleHQ/ios-client-sdk"
```

Then, run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks`. Drag the built .xcframework bundles from Carthage/Build into the "Frameworks and Libraries" section of your applicationâ€™s Xcode project.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Sswift" label="Swift Package Manager">

To use the library with Swift Package Manager, include it as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file like so:

```
...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/ios-client-sdk.git", .upToNextMinor("1.2.1")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YOUR_TARGET",
            dependencies: ["DevCycle"]
        )
    ],
...
```

You can also add it through Xcode, i.e. `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`, then enter the repository clone URL.
