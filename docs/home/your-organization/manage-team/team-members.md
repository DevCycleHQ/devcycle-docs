## Overview

This article serves to explain how to add Team Members to your organization. All Members within your organization will automatically have access to all features, however they may have different roles. To read more about roles, read [Team Member Roles](/docs/home/your-organization/manage-team/member-roles).

### Adding Members

Members are added to an Organization from the [Organization Settings](/docs/home/feature-management/organizing-your-flags-and-variables/organizations-projects#organization-settings) page. 

Once here, navigate to the "Team" page of the settings:

![An Organization's Team Settings Page, with a list of members in the current org](/team.png)

This page will contain a list of all Members within the current Organization. 

From here, you can click the "Add Team Member" button to add a new Member to your Organization.

This will bring up a window where you can enter the email of the user you wish to invite:

This will send an email to the Member, allowing them to start the process of [creating an account](/docs/home/feature-management/getting-started/creating-an-account)

When a Member is added and an account is created, the user will begin within the Member role. To learn more about Roles, read [Team Member Roles](/docs/home/your-organization/manage-team/member-roles).
