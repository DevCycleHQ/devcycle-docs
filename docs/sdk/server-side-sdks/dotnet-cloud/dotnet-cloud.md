# DevCycle .NET / C# SDK

Welcome to the DevCycle .NET Server SDK, which interfaces with the [DevCycle Bucketing API](/bucketing-api/#tag/devcycle).

All requests, including user data are sent to DevCycle servers to ensure the User is bucketed correctly and will receive the correct variation.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={4} />

The SDK is available as a package on Nuget. It is also open source and can be viewed on Github.
