Organizations are the top level of the Account hierarchy within DevCycle, and are where all Users and Projects are managed. Users within an organization will have the same [permissions](/extras/permissions) across all projects, and a user may be part of multiple Organizations.

To view the current Organization (or change Organizations) click on your user avatar on the top right of the DevCycle Dashboard. The active Organization will have a green badge next to it.

:::tip

[Granular permissions](/extras/permissions) are only available on business or enterprise plans, if you'd like to turn on permissions message us at support[at]devcycle.com

**Discovering Other Organizations**

To find other organizations that might have been created by people within your Company / Domain, you can easily [navigate to the Discovery page](https://app.devcycle.com/organizationDiscovery) by selecting `Find and Create Orgs` from the avatar dropdown.

This will lead you to a list of all of the organizations within your domain's network. From here, you can request to join other organizations, or create new ones.

:::caution
Please note that organizational settings cannot currently be viewed or changed through the CLI and require use of the dashboard.

## Organization Roles

Roles within DevCycle determine what functionality specific Members in an organization may access. They can be used to ensure that certain users are entirely unable to make modifications to any Production environments.

There are three main roles in DevCycle:

| Role          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**     | This is the default role given to all users on the platform when not on an Enterprise or Business plan. All owners of an organization will be able to create/modify all items.                                                              |
| **Publisher** | A publisher can create and modify all things in the platform except for other members' roles. They can modify items that are in production and can also fully delete features and archive variables even if in production.                  |
| **Member**    | This role prevents any modification of any item that is enabled in production. This includes modifying targeting rules, variables, variations, or environments in any scenario where it would impact a feature in a Production environment. |

The table below displays the built-in roles and their associated permissions:

| Permission                    | Owner | Publisher | Member |
| ----------------------------- | :---: | :-------: | :----: |
| Add Team Members              |  ✅   |    ✅     |   ✅   |
| Remove Team Members           |  ✅   |           |        |
| Edit Team Member Roles        |  ✅   |           |        |
| Modify Features in Production |  ✅   |    ✅     |        |

For more information, check out the [Permissions](/extras/permissions) documentation.

**Assigning Roles**

To assign a role to a team member, simply navigate to their profile. If you have the requisite role, you will be able to assign a new role to the member by using the Role dropdown.

After you have selected a role, click "save" and the team member's permissions will be automatically updated.
