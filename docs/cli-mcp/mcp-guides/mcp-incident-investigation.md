DevCycleâ€™s MCP server helps you investigate and resolve incidents more efficiently by providing real-time access to Feature Flag data within the context of your codebase, enhanced with natural language communication through AI. To get started on your own, check out our [MCP Getting Started](/cli-mcp/mcp-getting-started) guide for setup instructions and a list of available MCP tools.

## Demo

In this video, we demonstrate how to use the MCP server to investigate an incident. You'll learn how to pull recent Feature Flag changes with the Audit Log MCP tool, and even revert a change, from within your favorite AI Client. For this demo, we are using [Dynatrace](/integrations/dynatrace/) to monitor application errors and Cursor as our editor and AI tool of choice.
