## Expanded Python SDK to include local bucketing

We're happy to share the release of our local-bucketing SDK for the Python platform! The expanded Python SDK allows you to limit the outbound requests made to DevCycle workers when making feature flagging decisions. You can now use a local bucketing Python SDK so your Python backend doesn't need to call out to DevCycle workers for every feature flag decision, helping improve speed and allowing for more security in the software delivery lifecycle. 

This is yet another in a stream of enhancements dedicated to making server-side SDKs that support local bucketing versions, letting you evaluate decisions within your own servers. Try it yourself today!
