OpenFeature is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works

## OpenFeature Remote Evaluation API

The [OpenFeature Remote Evaluation API (OFREP)](https://github.com/open-feature/protocol) is a new open standard API
interface for feature flagging that allows the use of generic providers to connect to any feature flag management
systems that supports the protocol.

**Note: the standard is in its very early stages and is subject to change.**

See our
[Bucketing API Documentation](<https://docs.devcycle.com/bucketing-api/#tag/OpenFeature-Remote-Evaluation-API-(OFREP)>)
for more information on how to consume the OpenFeature Remote Evaluation API with DevCycle.
