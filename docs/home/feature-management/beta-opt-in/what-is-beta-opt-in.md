## Overview

Beta Opt-In provides the ability to make any feature released via DevCycle have a self-serve way to enable it for end users. This all happens through a simple iFrame that can be implemented on your website, that is powered by DevCycle.

This means that if you are looking to run a beta program, but don't want to manually manage access to beta features you can just add them to the Beta Opt-In widget and your users can toggle them on or off as they wish.

Beta Opt-In isn't limited to beta program management though, it can be leveraged to give your users power to customize their experience without needing to build your own way of managing user preferences. In this way Beta Opt-In could be used for individual preference management, given QA teams a debugging dashboard where they could override features and much more.

If you have an idea for this widget but don't know how to execute it just reach out to support@devcycle.com and we'd be happy to help you figure out the best path forward.
