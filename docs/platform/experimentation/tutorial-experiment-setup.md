In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to create an experiment in DevCycle from scratch, including setting up metrics to track and analyze experiment results. 

## Intro and Experiment Overview

We begin the series by reviewing what we'll cover in the rest of the videos below and go through an example of an experiment overview that outlines the criteria of the experiment we're creating.

## Metric Setup

In this video, we walk through how to create a new metric from the metrics page, describing how it gets populated and what type of data you can measure with it.

## Feature and Variable Setup

After creating metrics that we want to use for the experiment, it's time to create the Feature and the variables that will control the experiment.

## Targeting Rule Setup

Continuing with the Feature creation, this video will walk you through setting up targeting rules for your Feature to define the users who should receive the experiment.

## Adding Metrics to Experiment Results

Finishing up, we can add the metrics that were created earlier to the Feature and show you an example of how the data appears in the experiment results section.
