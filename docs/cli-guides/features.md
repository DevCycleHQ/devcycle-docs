# CLI: Features

## Manage

Once you have installed and authorized the CLI, select your relevant organization and project then run one of the following commands depending on your use case:

To retrieve all features for a project from the management API run:

```bash
dvc features get
```

You should be presented with something which looks like the following which represents a project with two features: `feature-a` with three variations (`variation-on`, `variation-off` and `variation-new`) and two associated variables (`variable-alpha` and `variation-beta`) and `feature-b` with two variations (`variation-on`, `variation-off`) no associated variables).

```

To list the keys of all features in a project run:

```bash
dvc features list
```

You should be presented with something which looks like the following:

```json
["feature-b", "feature-a"]
```

## Create

Once you have installed and authorized the CLI, select your relevant organization and project then run one the following commands:

```bash
dvc features create
```

You will be prompted to choose a Name, Key and Description.

If successful you will receive something which resembles the following (which demonstrates creating a new feature called `Feature C` with a key of `feature-c` and no description):

```json
{
  "_id": "q1w2e3r4t5yy",
  "_project": "w2w2we3r4t5yy7u7i",
  "source": "cli",
  "type": "release",

      "variables": {
        "feature-c": true
      }
    },
    {
      "_id": "w2e4t5t6y6y",
      "key": "variation-off",
      "name": "Variation Off",
      "variables": {
        "feature-c": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "controlVariation": "variation-on",
  "variables": [
    {
      "_id": "1q2w3er4t5t",
      "_project": "3er4y6yu7i8i85y",
      "_feature": "3r4t5y6ui89o9o",
      "name": "Feature C",
      "key": "feature-c",
      "type": "Boolean",
      "status": "active",
      "source": "cli",
      "_createdBy": "google-oauth2|3e4r5t6y7u7i8i",
      "createdAt": "2023-07-27T19:38:51.480Z",
      "updatedAt": "2023-07-27T19:38:51.480Z"
    }
  ],
  "tags": [],
  "readonly": false,
  "sdkVisibility": {
    "mobile": true,
    "client": true,
    "server": true
  }
}

Feature "Feature C" successfully created!

To update the targeting rules, use:

    dvc targeting update feature-c
```

## Update

Once you have installed and authorized the CLI, select your relevant organization and project then run the following command:

```bash
dvc features update
```

You will be prompted to select a feature you would like to update, and can update the `name`, `key`, `description`, `sdkVisibility`, `variables` and `variations`, then will receive a response which resembles something like is found below (which demonstrates removing all variables from feature named `feature-a`):

```json

  "_id": "o9i8u7y65t",

    {
      "_id": "1q2w3e4r5tyu7",
      "key": "variation-on",
      "name": "Variation On",
      "variables": {}
    },
    {
      "_id": "t4t4t4t32t2t2g2g",
      "key": "variation-off",
      "name": "Variation Off",
      "variables": {}
    },
    {
      "_id": "q1w2e3r4t56y",
      "key": "new-variation",
      "name": "New Variation",
      "variables": {}
    }
  ],
  "controlVariation": "variation-on",
  "variables": [],
  "tags": [],
  "readonly": false,
  "settings": {
    "optInEnabled": false,
    "publicName": "",
    "publicDescription": ""
  },
  "sdkVisibility": {
    "mobile": true,
    "client": true,
    "server": true
  }
}
```

## Delete

To delete a feature for your selected project run:
