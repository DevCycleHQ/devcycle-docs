### Overview

DevCycle for Jira enables the linking of Jira tickets directly to features within DevCycle, showing the feature status within Jira.

Feature development teams have a number of different tools to track and enhance their workflow from project management, to code repositories and feature management tools. When these tools have siloed information it can be very difficult to piece together what the exact status of a feature is in the development lifecycle.


DevCycle for Jira solves this problem by creating a two-way sync between Jira, the number 1 project management tool and DevCycle, the number 1 feature management tool. With DevCycle for Jira enabled, teams can quickly and easily see which feature flags are associated with their tickets and understand their current configuration and status, making standups, code review, QA and planning instantly easier.

**See your Feature's status in Jira**

Easily connect your Feature Flags and see their status directly in Jira.

**Connect your tickets in DevCycle**

Simply connect your Jira Ticket IDs to a Feature in DevCycle. You can connect as many as you want, and connect one ticket to multiple features and vice-versa.
