There are two ways to initialize the SDK:

- Non-Blocking: This loads your application and makes a request to initialize the SDK in the background. Once this request is complete,
  your application will be ready to use the SDK.
- Blocking: This allows you to delay the rendering of your application until the request to initialize the SDK is completed.

To use these providers, you must grab the SDK Key from the DevCycle Dashboard.
You can optionally pass in a user object to the provider to initialize the SDK.
If you do not pass in a user to the provider, it will create an anonymous user and initialize the SDK with it.
You can then call the `identifyUser` method on the client once the user has been authenticated.
See [Identifying Users & Setting Properties](/sdk/features#identify) for more details.

## Non-Blocking

The `withDevCycleProvider` function initializes the React SDK and wraps your root component. This provider may cause your app
to flicker when it is first rendered, as it is waiting for the SDK to initialize.

```js
import { withDevCycleProvider } from '@devcycle/react-native-client-sdk'
```

```js
export default withDevCycleProvider({ sdkKey: '<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>' })(
  App,
)
```

## Blocking

The `useIsDevCycleInitialized` hook allows you to block rendering of your application until SDK initialization is complete. This ensures your app
does not flicker due to value changes and enables you to control what you want displayed when initialization isn't finished yet.

```js
import {
  useIsDevCycleInitialized,
  withDevCycleProvider,
} from '@devcycle/react-native-client-sdk'
```

```js
function App() {
  const devcycleReady = useIsDevCycleInitialized()

  if (!devcycleReady) return <LoadingState />
  return <TheRestofYourApp />
}

export default withDevCycleProvider({ sdkKey: '<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>' })(
  App,
)
```

## Provider Config

The `withDevCycleProvider` function accepts a Provider Config object:

[DevCycle ProviderConfig Typescript Schema](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ADevCycleHQ%2Fjs-sdks+export+type+ProviderConfig+language%3ATypeScript+path%3A*types.ts&type=code)

| Property | Type                                                                                       | Description            |

| sdkKey   | String                                                                                     | SDK key                |
| user     | [DevCycleUser](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/sdk/js/src/types.ts#L55)    | DevCycleUser object    |
| options  | [DevCycleOptions](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/sdk/js/src/types.ts#L44) | DevCycleOptions object |

## Initialization Options

The SDK exposes various initialization options which can be set by passing a `DevCycleOptions` object in the Provider Config:
