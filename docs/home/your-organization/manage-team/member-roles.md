### Roles

There are three main roles in DevCycle

**Owner**

This is the default role given to all users on the platform. All members of an organization will be able to create/modify all items. 

**Member**

This role prevents any modification of any item that is enabled in production. This includes modifying targeting rules, variables, variations, or environments in any scenario where it would impact a feature in a Production environment.
