3. Once the DevCycle app has been added, you can now subscribe to Feature changes on a project-level or by individual Feature(s).
4. First, navigate to the Slack channel where you would like to have the Slack messages to be posted.

   - To add a subscription for project-level changes, use the command `/devcycle subscribe project-key`. To find a project's respective key, go to your organization's [Project Settings page](https://app.devcycle.com/r/settings/projects) and copy the key under the Project name.

   - To add a subscription for individual feature changes, use the command `/devcycle subscribe project-key [-f feature-key]`.
   - To add a subscription for a project or feature changes on a specific environment, add the flag `[-e environment-key]` to the command. For example,
     - All Project changes for the specified Environment: `/devcycle subscribe project-key [-e environment-key]`
     - All Feature changes that impact the specified Environment: `/devcycle subscribe project-key [-f feature-key] [-e environment-key]`

5. Once you've susbcribed, you're all set! Go ahead and make some changes to a Feature then check your Slack Channel for notifications.
