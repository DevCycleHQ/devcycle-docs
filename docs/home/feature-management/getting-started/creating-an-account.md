## Overview

The first thing you need to do to get started with DevCycle is to create an account and organization and add any colleagues to that organization. This page will get you up and running with a Free Account in a couple minutes.

If you already have an account feel free to skip ahead to shipping [Your First Feature](/home/feature-management/getting-started/your-first-feature) with DevCycle.

## Create a New Account

If you don't yet have an account with DevCycle that's not a problem! [Simply make a completely free account right here.](https://app.devcycle.com/?isSignUp=true)

### Creating / Joining an Organization

When you first sign up, you will notice that you will be prompted to create an [Organization](/home/feature-management/organizing-your-flags-and-variables/organizations-projects). An organization is where you'll be able to put all of your projects, and invite all of your team members.

If signing up with a non-generic email, you may notice that others with your company email may have signed up and created an organization already. You can choose to create one yourself, or just request to join one!
