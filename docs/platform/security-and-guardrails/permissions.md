# Permissions

At DevCycle, our primary goal for permissions is to protect production. We've designed our permissions to be lightweight, straightforward and simple while ensuring production is protected.

Specifically, we offer Permissions Gating to protect Environments which are marked as "production" from unauthorized changes. This allows Organizations to manage which users can modify the Targeting Status, Rules and served Variations in a production Environment that may impact their end users.

Permissions can be enabled for Organizations on our Business or Enterprise plans. Please contact our [support](mailto:support@devcycle.com) team to get started.

Permissions enforcement will apply to all Projects and Production-type Environments within your Organization.

## What Can Users Do?

To ensure usability, all users are able to make any edits to a Feature when production targeting isn't enabled. Permissions Gating and its protections come into play when production targeting is either enabled or a user is attempting to enable production.

See below for the full details on what each user role can do when permissions are enabled.
