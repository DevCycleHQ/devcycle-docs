You can choose to connect a DevCycle project to Jira individually, or connect your entire DevCycle Organization and all of its projects to your Jira project with a single token. Details below.

### Connecting an Organization (all projects) to Jira

1. If you choose to connect an organization to Jira, it will connect all DevCycle projects to Jira. To do this, use the Organization's jira token which can be found under Settings in your DevCycle dashboard.

### Connecting an Individual DevCycle Project

## Usage

### Within DevCycle

To link a DevCycle Feature to a Jira ticket, first navigate to the feature you wish to link.

In the "Settings" section of this feature, you will see an area to enter Jira IDs.

Enter the IDs of the tickets you'd like to associate to this feature. Note that they must be part of the linked Jira project.

You may enter as many IDs as you'd like:

    If you would like to contribute to an existing integration or tool, all of DevCycle's tools and integrations  are <a href="https://github.com/devcycleHQ">open source on the DevCycle github repository.</a>

 Further, if you'd like to create a new tool or integration, a great starting point is <a href="/management-api/">DevCycle's Management API</a> which allows you to modify and interact with features and more within a devcycle project, as well as the <a href="/bucketing-api/">DevCycle Bucketing API</a>  which is used to give users features and variables (as used within the DevCycle SDKs!)
