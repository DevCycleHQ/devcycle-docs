The Audit Log tracks all modifications made to a Feature. DevCycle captures the DevCycle user who made the change, a time stamp, and what was modified on each Feature save. 

The Audit Log is located at the bottom of the Feature form in the Data & Results section.

You can filter modfications by environment, DevCycle user, and for a particular date range.

The title of each modification card, highlights the change that was made to the Feature upon clicking save. If multiple changes were made on a Feature save and/or there were modifications made to more than one Environment, the card will show the total number modifications made. 

Click the `View Details` button on each card for more information about each modification. 

Modifications are organized by Environment with each card. The color of each Environment tag corresponds to the [color selected for that Environment](/essentials/environments#from-the-dashboard-1). 

Items that are added to the Feature will be highlighted in green in the left-hand column of the modification card (see below), and removals or deletions of items will be highlighted in red.
