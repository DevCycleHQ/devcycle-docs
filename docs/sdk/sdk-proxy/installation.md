# Installation

We provide the proxy in a few formats for usage:

- Raw Source (Go)
- Docker Image
- OS Packaged Binary

The raw source can be used if building a custom image is required, or if you need to build a custom binary for
your environment that will use the exposed API to instantiate the proxy.

We recommend using the OS packaged version for easy future upgrades and management.

## Deployment

### Debian based

```bash
sudo dpkg -i devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy_*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### RPM based

```bash
sudo rpm -i devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy_*.rpm
```

## Configuration

A sample config.json file is included in the package and can be found
at `/etc/devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy/config.json.example`. The most current
version of the file can be found on
our [GitHub](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/local-bucketing-proxy/blob/main/config.json.example).

Alternatively - it can be configured via environment variables. The following environment variables are supported:

### Environment Variables

`DVC_LB_PROXY_SDK_KEY` is the only required environment variable if not using a configuration file

## Post-Installation

If you have installed an OS packaged version of the proxy - the binary will be installed
to `/usr/bin/devcycle-local-bucketing-proxy`.

You will need to configure a separate supervisor/orchestrator such as `systemd` or `upstart` if no you need to create a
long-lived process.

We recommend keeping the logging output of the proxy available as it streams to `stdout` and `stderr` by default.
To enable debug http logging, set the `GIN_MODE` environment variable to `debug`.
