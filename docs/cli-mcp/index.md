# CLI / MCP Overview

DevCycle provides two complementary tools for managing feature flags: a command-line interface for developers and an MCP server for use with AI assistants.

## DevCycle CLI

The [DevCycle CLI](/cli) is a comprehensive command-line tool for feature flag management.

### Key Features

- **Feature Flag Management**: Create, update, and delete feature flags
- **Environment Control**: Manage targeting across different environments
- **Project Administration**: Switch between projects and manage settings
- **Integration Ready**: Perfect for automation and CI/CD workflows
- **Local Development**: Test and validate flags locally

### Quick Start

1. Install: `npm install -g @devcycle/cli`
2. Login: `dvc login sso`
3. Select project: `dvc projects select`
4. Start using CLI commands like: `dvc features list`

## DevCycle MCP Server

The [DevCycle MCP Server](/cli-mcp/mcp-getting-started) is based on our CLI and enables AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients to directly interact with your DevCycle feature flags, environments, and projects through natural language.

**Example interactions:**

- _"Create a new feature flag called 'new-checkout-flow'"_
- _"Enable targeting for my-feature in production"_
- _"An incident occurred at 5pm today, show me what changes happened within the hour before the incident"_

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to data sources and tools. DevCycle's MCP server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your feature flag management, allowing you to:

- **Create and manage feature flags** using natural language
- **Configure targeting rules** without writing complex queries
- **Test features safely** using self-targeting and overrides
- **Get real-time insights** about your feature flag usage

### Key Benefits

- **Natural Language Interface**: Use commands like "Create a feature flag for the new checkout flow"
- **Production Safety**: Built-in warnings and confirmations for destructive actions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 35+ tools across all DevCycle operations

## Choose Your Workflow

| Tool    | Best For                                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLI** | Direct command-line control, scripting, CI/CD integration |
| **MCP** | Natural language interactions, AI-assisted development    |

Both tools use the same DevCycle APIs and can be used together seamlessly.
