### Introduction

Welcome to DevCycle Tools & Integrations! Here you will find all of the various first party tools made with the 
DevCycle APIs, as well as third party integrations to connect DevCycle to the tools of your needs.

**Contributing to DevCycle or creating a new Integration:**

If you would like to contribute to an existing integration or tool, all of DevCycle's tools and integrations 
are [open source on the DevCycle github repository.](https://github.com/devcycleHQ)!

Further, if you'd like to create a new tool or integration, a great starting point is
[DevCycle's Management API](/management-api/) which allows you to modify and interact with
features and more within a devcycle project, as well as the [DevCycle bucketing API](/bucketing-api/)
which is used to give users features and variables (as used within the DevCycle SDKs!)
