DevCycleâ€™s MCP server makes it easier to investigate and mitigate incidents by giving you real-time access to Feature Flag data in the context of your codebase, combined with natural language communication through AI. To get started on your own, check out our [MCP Getting Started](/cli-mcp/mcp-getting-started) guide for setup instructions and a list of available MCP tools.

## Demo

In this video, we demonstrate how to use the MCP server to investigate an incident. You'll see how to pull recent Feature Flag changes with the Audit Log MCP tool, and even revert a change, all from within your favorite AI Client. For this demo, we are using Dynatrace to monitor application errors and Cursor as our editor and AI tool of choice.
