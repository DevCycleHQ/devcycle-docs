# DevCycle iOS Client SDK

This Client SDK for DevCycle provides a universal Swift Framework to use DevCycle within your 
iOS / macOS / tvOS / watchOS application. This SDK uses our Client SDK APIs to perform all user 
segmentation and bucketing for the SDK, providing fast response times using our globally distributed 
edge workers all around the world.

The SDK is available as a package on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/DevCycle), 
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). 
It is also open source and can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/ios-client-sdk).
