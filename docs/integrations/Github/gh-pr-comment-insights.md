## Overview

**[Github Marketplace Listing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/devcycle-feature-flag-insights-for-pull-requests)**

## Overview
With this Github action, information on which [DevCycle](https://devcycle.com/) features have been added or removed in a code change will be shown directly on each Pull Request as a comment.

**Note: This is intended for `pull_request` workflow events**

### Example Output

![Example Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevCycleHQ/feature-flag-pr-insights-action/main/example_output.png)

### Usage
Create a new Actions workflow in your GitHub repository (e.g. devcycle-insights.yml) in the .github/workflows directory. In your new file, paste the following code:

```yaml
on: pull_request

jobs:
  dvc-feature-flag-insights:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate DevCycle PR Insights
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: DevCycleHQ/feature-flag-pr-insights-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          # Token generated by GitHub
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Your DevCycle project key
          project-key: your-project-key
          # Your organization's DevCycle API client ID & secret
          client-id: ${{ secrets.DVC_CLIENT_ID }}
          client-secret: ${{ secrets.DVC_CLIENT_SECRET }}

```

We recommend including your DevCycle API credentials and project token as inputs.
If included, the PR comment will be enriched with Feature Flag data from DevCycle.

When referencing your API client ID and secret, we recommend using [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) to store your credentials securely.

### Inputs

| input | required | description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `github-token` | yes | The GitHub Actions token e.g. `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `project-key` | no | Your DevCycle project key, see [Projects](https://app.devcycle.com/r/projects) |
| `client-id` | no | Your organization's API client ID, see [Organization Settings](https://app.devcycle.com/r/settings) |
| `client-secret` | no | Your organization's API client secret, see [Organization Settings](https://app.devcycle.com/r/settings) |

### Configuration
The patterns used to identify references to variables in your code are fully customizable.
This action uses the [DevCycle CLI](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/cli) under the hood, for details on how to configure the pattern matcher see the [CLI configuration](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/cli#configuration).
