# DevCycle Next.js SDK

The DevCycle Next.js SDK lets you easily integrate your Next.js applications with DevCycle.

<CustomDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} columnWidth={4} />

The SDK is available as a package on npm. It is also open source and can be viewed on Github.
This SDK depends on the [fetch](https://github.com/BuilderIO/this-package-uses-fetch) API.
