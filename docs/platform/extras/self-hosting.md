# Self-Hosting

If you are looking for a feature flagging solution there is a chance that you are looking for a solution that is completely self-hosted.

At DevCycle we've taken a hybrid approach, where we host the dashboard, but all of the feature flag decision logic can live within your servers and application. With this approach you get the best of both worlds. 
You get the high availability and regular updates of a managed service and you get the security, compliance and control of self-hosting.

These docs will show you how to configure your DevCycle environment to get the same benefits of self-hosting, without the hassles.

## Security and Privacy

Organizations often choose self-hosted solutions to maintain complete control over their data and infrastructure. With DevCycle if you run our [Local Bucketing Server-Side SDKs](#INSERTLINK) or [SDK Proxy](#INSERTLINK) you can have complete control over network traffic.



## Compliance Requirements

Self-hosted solutions help organizations meet strict regulatory requirements:
- Easier compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations when data stays within the organization
- Better control over data protection requirements for regulated industries
- Complete oversight of where and how user data is stored and processed

## Reliability and Control

Self-hosting provides greater control over service availability:
- No dependency on third-party service availability or performance
- Better expectations and control over service levels
- Elimination of multi-tenant related risks that could affect system performance

## Cost Effectiveness

For larger organizations, self-hosting can be more economical:
- SaaS pricing typically scales with usage, becoming expensive at higher volumes
- Avoiding monthly active user (MAU) management and associated costs
- Research shows approximately one-third of cloud services spending is often wasted

## Flexibility

Self-hosted solutions offer greater customization options:
- Ability to set up specific integrations and workflows that meet unique needs
- More control over the architecture and implementation details
- Easier integration with existing internal systems and processes
