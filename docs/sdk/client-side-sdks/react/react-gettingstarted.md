There are two ways to initialize the SDK:
* Non-Blocking: This loads your application and makes a request to initialize the SDK in the background. Once this request is complete,
  your application will be ready to use the SDK.
* Blocking: This allows you to delay the rendering of your application until the request to initialize the SDK is completed.

To use these providers, you must get the SDK Key from the DevCycle Dashboard.
You can optionally pass in a user object to the provider to initialize the SDK.
If you do not pass in a user to the provider, it will create an anonymous user and initialize the SDK with it.
You can then call the `identifyUser` method on the client once the user has been authenticated.
See [Identifying Users & Setting Properties](/sdk/features#identify) for more details.

:::info

 Itâ€™s best to initialize DevCycle in your root component (App.jsx or App.tsx), so that its hooks can be accessed from anywhere within your application.

:::


## Non-Blocking

The withDevCycleProvider higher-order component (HOC) initializes the React SDK and wraps your root component. This provider may cause your app
to flicker when it is first rendered, as it is waiting for the SDK to initialize.

```js
import { withDevCycleProvider } from '@devcycle/react-client-sdk'
```
```js
export default withDevCycleProvider({ sdkKey: '<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>' })(App)
```

## Blocking

The `useIsDevCycleInitialized` hook allows you to block rendering of your application until SDK initialization is complete. This ensures your app does not flicker due to value changes and enables you to control what you want displayed when initialization isn't finished yet.

```js
import { useIsDevCycleInitialized, withDevCycleProvider } from '@devcycle/react-client-sdk'
```
```js
function App() {
    const dvcReady = useIsDevCycleInitialized()
    
    if (!dvcReady) return <LoadingState/>
    return <TheRestofYourApp/>
}
    
export default withDevCycleProvider({ sdkKey: '<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>' })(App)
```

:::caution

The `asyncWithDVCProvider` function has been deprecated as of version 1.3.0

:::

The `asyncWithDVCProvider` function is similar to the `withDevCycleProvider` function, but allows you to block rendering of your application
until SDK initialization is complete. This ensures your app does not flicker due to value changes.

```js
import { asyncWithDVCProvider } from '@devcycle/react-client-sdk'
```
```js
(async () => {
    const DevCycleProvider = await asyncWithDVCProvider({ sdkKey: '<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>' })

    ReactDOM.render(
        <DevCycleProvider>
            <App />
        </DevCycleProvider>
    )
})();
```

## Deferred Initialization
In many cases, user data is not available at the time the `DevCycleProvider` is created. If the provider is not passed a
`user` object, then by default the SDK will be instantiated with an "anonymous" user and a configuration will be 
downloaded from DevCycle. The SDK will be considered "initialized" and the aforementioned `useIsDevCycleInitialized` hook
will return `true` once this configuration has been downloaded.

If you would like to defer initialization of the SDK until your user data is available, you can pass the 
`deferInitialization` option to the `DevCycleProvider`. This will cause the SDK to not fetch a configuration until the
[`devcycleClient.identifyUser`](/sdk/client-side-sdks/react/react-usage#identifying-users) method is called with the user data. 
The `useIsDevCycleInitialized` hook will return `false` until
that method has been called and a corresponding config has been retrieved. Until that config is retrieved, all calls
to retrieve variable values will return their default values.

```js
import { useIsDevCycleInitialized, withDevCycleProvider } from '@devcycle/react-client-sdk'

let identified = false
function App() {
    // e.g. a React Query style hook that retrieves user data
    const { data: user, isFetched } = useUserFromMyUserStorage()
    if (user && !identified) {
        devcycleClient.identifyUser(user)
        identified = true
    }
    const dvcReady = useIsDevCycleInitialized()
    
    // rendering is blocked until the user is loaded, and has finished being identified in DevCycle
    if (!dvcReady) return <LoadingState/>
    return <TheRestofYourApp/>
}
    
export default withDevCycleProvider({ 
    sdkKey: '<DEVCYCLE_CLIENT_SDK_KEY>',
    options: {
        deferInitialization: true
    } 
})(App)
```

## Provider Config

The `withDevCycleProvider` function accepts a Provider Config object:

[DevCycle ProviderConfig Typescript Schema](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/sdk/react/src/types.ts#L3)

| Property | Type | Description            |
|------------|------|------------------------|
| sdkKey | string | SDK key                |
| user | [DevCycleUser](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/sdk/js/src/types.ts#L55) | DevCycleUser object    |
| options | [DevCycleOptions](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/sdk/js/src/types.ts#L44) | DevCycleOptions object |

## Initialization Options

The SDK exposes various initialization options which can be set by passing a `DevCycleOptions` object in the Provider Config:

[DevCycleOptions Typescript Schema](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/sdk/js/src/types.ts#L44)

| DevCycle Option             | Type | Description                                                                                                    |

| logLevel               | [DevCycleDefaultLogLevel](https://github.com/DevCycleHQ/js-sdks/blob/main/lib/shared/types/src/logger.ts#L12) | Set log level of the default logger. Options are: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. Defaults to `info`.        |
| apiProxyURL            | string | Allows the SDK to communicate with a proxy of DevCycle bucketing API / client SDK API.                              |

| disableRealtimeUpdates | boolean | Disable Realtime Updates                                                                                       |
| deferInitialization    | boolean | Defer initialization (fetching configuration from DevCycle) until user is identified with `identifyUser` call  |
